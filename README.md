## Impetus

This topic is the first jump into geospatial analysis in `R`. There is a very high-level discussion of projections, ellipsoids, and datum, and then a dive into the data using the enigmatic Sonoran Desert bark beetle as a model data set.



## Student Learning Objectives

At the end of this topic, you should be able to:  

- Describe the importance of Ellipsoids & Datum in spatial data.
- Use both `sf` & `ggplot` in visualizing point data.  
- Be able to transform point data from one projection to another.
- Easily create static and dynamic maps from point data.

## Content
 - The [slides](https://dyerlabteaching.github.io/Spatial-Points/slides.html) for this topic.
 - A longer [narrative](https://dyerlabteaching.github.io/Spatial-Points/narrative.html) going in more depth on the slide content.
 - The [in-class](https://dyerlabteaching.github.io/Spatial-Points/in-class.html) activity.
 - An `sf` [cheat sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/main/sf.pdf)
